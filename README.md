# ‚ùì What is Wacatac 0.5?
Wacatac 0.5 is a GDI trojan coded in C++, With only 5 payloads!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important!!!
This is a potentially harmful program that can cause your system death & data loss. This software also displays flashing lights and plays loud sounds, so if you have a photosensitive disease like epilepsy, don't run this or watch any videos about it for your safety.

By running this program, you assume full responsibility for any damages that may occur. Therefore, the creator (NS) will not be held responsible for anything caused by this software. By the way, this was created for educational and entertainment purposes, so don't use it to do malicious acts like sharing with a friend.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è For skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release Wacatac 0.5's source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change... 

So for that reason I added a `MIT license`. In other words, <b>if you use/modify a part of my code, you need to make your project open source and give me credit!</b>
